  b] Installation locations
     You need to set the locations where you want to install newbreeze, and its plugins. By default, the prefix is /usr.
     The newbreeze app is installed at /usr/bin/, libnewbreeze-common.so at /usr/lib/newbreeze, plugins at /usr/lib/newbreeze/plugins.
     These are set in the respective .pro files. You'll have to edit the individual .pro files.

     NOTE: Please make note that we use RPATH to locate libnewbreeze-common.so. Setting improper values to $PREFIX, or in QMAKE_RPATHDIR
     will result in newbreeze crashing out with error.
