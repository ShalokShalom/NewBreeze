  b] Installation locations
     You need to set the locations where you want to install newbreeze, and its plugins. By default, the prefix is /usr.
     The newbreeze app is installed at /usr/bin/, libnewbreeze-common.so at /usr/lib/newbreeze, plugins at /usr/lib/newbreeze/plugins.
     These are set in the respective .pro files. You'll have to edit the individual .pro files.

     NOTE: Please make note that we use RPATH to locate libnewbreeze-common.so. Setting improper values to $PREFIX, or in QMAKE_RPATHDIR
     will result in newbreeze crashing out with error.


2. Building
===========
  a] Preparing the Makefile
     In the terminal, type

         qmake -qt5

  b] Building
     In the terminal, type

         make -j4

     Feel free to replace 4 in 'make -j4' with the number of cpu cores you have.

3. Installation
===============
     In the terminal, type

         sudo make install

     This will install NewBreeze, the plugins and all the include files in the location set during Stage 1
