NewBreeze v2.0.1
================

- Some Bugs in NBStartup and NBSettings caused the settings configuration file to be improperly written causing the file names in the item views
  to disappear. This would happen white opening multiple windows. As a solution to this, only the data settings that have been changed by the
  user get written to the settings file. This called for a major remodel of NBSettings class.

- NBTreeView did not have drag and drop support which has been enabled in this release.

- While pressing "Ctrl+A" the "Select All" action, the InfoBar showed unfeasible values like X Folders, Y Files and (X + Y) x 6 Others. This
  was caused by a bug that resulted in all the indexes corresponding to 6 other column of the model being selected and taken into consideration
  for selection counting.

- The FileIO jobs running in the background sometimes used to get killed nad other times continued Gui-less. To prevent it, the Paste dialogs
  now are shown before closing NewBreeze.
