NewBreeze v2.0.0
================

NOTE: This is just a preview release. Some code is non functional, but mostly usabe. Important functionality like cut/copy/paste,
delete, properties are working smoothly. Some of the minor functions like drag-drop or Detailed View are non functional.

NOTE: With the NewBreeze2 series, I have moved on to the Major:Minor:Patch versioning system.

While retaining all the functionality of NewBreeze series, I present to you the new and improved version NewBreeze2 series.
This version is a preview release. Some of the functionality may be missing, or buggy. Here is a summary of changes.

- The main UI was redesigned from scratch. While the NBSideBar and the NBInfoBar (formerly NBStatusBar) have retained the same code,
NBFolderView has been rewritten. NBToolBar has been scrapped, and replaced by NBAddressBar and NBQuickMenuBar.

- NBFolderView is now a QStackWidget, with NBListView and NBTreeView being the file system viewer. NBFolderView mostly acts as an interface
between NBIconView/NBTreeView.

- QFileSystemWatcher which was the ItemModel in the NewBreeze series has been replaced b NBFileSystemModel, a subclass of QAbstractItemModel.
It incorporates all the necessary functionality like mimetype based icon rendering, history, etc.

- The DragDrop functionality is broken. It is not possible to drag items, nor do the dropped items cause any signals to be emitted.

- I have tried to add DetailsView based on QTreeView, though it is not completely functional and buggy. In the following releases, namely,
alpha and beta I intend to fix this.

- NBThumbsCache which was causing delays in loading of directories containing large number of files slow has been scrapped. NBFileSystemModel
by default does the work.

- NBIcon class has been renamed as NBIconProvider, but in no way similar to QIconProvider.

- Deleting files is now a Threaded Core IO process.

- NBHistory class is now redundant, NBFileSystemModel manages it by default.

- All dialogs are now a subclass of NBDialog.

- Cut-Copy-Paste in this release has the same code as NewBreeze series. It will be separated into CoreIO and GUI classes.

- Added server class, enabling resource sharing and fast startup of subsequent windows, once a window is opened.

- StlyeSheets are now generated dynamically based on predefined templates.
