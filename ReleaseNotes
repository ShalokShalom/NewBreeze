NewBreeze v3.0.0
================

NewBreeze v2.3.0
================

This release onwards I am supporting a Native GUI. i.e., GUI with window manager borders and background and system colors.
To download the Native GUI, please check https://github.com/marcusbritanicus/NewBreeze-native/

=> NBFileSystemModel( QAbstractItemModel )
   - NBFileSystemModel is now a categorized item model. Categories can be name, size, type or modification time based. Categorization can
     easily be switched on or off via setCategorizationEnabled( bool )
   - NBFileSystem now detects file size changes and automatically updates it.

=> NBIconView( QAbstractItemView )
   NBIconView is now categorized item view. It supports both a categorized and a non categorized item model.

=> 'Show in groups'
   This switch helps to switch on or of the Categorization of the Model and the View.

=> QActionGroup
   The older approach of using radiobuttons and making them exclusive to provide 'View Modes' list and 'Sort By' menu has been replaced by the
   cleaner QActionGroup approach. This is much more elegant and clean.

=> Move
   The intra-device move is now purely a renaming action.
   In case a directory which is being moved exists then a full-fledged FileIO will be performed.

=> FileIO
   While copying/moving a file, if by chance, the target exists, then the newly copied file will be renamed as *basename* - Copy.*ext*
   While copying/moving a folder, if by chance, the target exist, then folder being copied gets merged with the existing folder, and newly
   copied files renamed as above

=> View Modes
   I have done away with the predefined view modes with fixed sizes. Now we have three view modes, the tiles view, the icons view and the
   details view. Icon size can be dynamically changed by pressing the 'Zoom In' and 'Zoom Out' key sequences. This changes the icon size by
   4px
   -> Icons And Tiles view: 16px <-->128px
   -> Tree view: 16px <--> 64px

=> Details
   Depending on the Icon Size, extra details will be shown for all the items in the tiles and the icons views. For now the order of details
   which are unveiled are hard coded into the program. This *may* be changed at a later date.

=> Delete GUI
   Since the delete process is very fast a gui is not required.

=> SidePanel
   > A much more compact panel is provided. The icons are folders, appications, catalogs, devices, bookmarks and trash.
   > When the mouse moves over the devices or the bookmarks icon, the panel expands to reveal the devices/bookmarks.
   > Similiar behaviour is observed when you drag items to the devices/bookmarks icons.
   > To delete files and folders, you can simply drag and drop them while pressing [ SHIFT ] button.

=> ODT and PDF preview
   It is now possible to preview odt file (Open Document Text) from LibreOffice/OpenOffice, and PDF files via the Peek option.
   ODT has limited support, but let's hope we do get some native support from Qt for rendering ODT in the future.
   Support for PDF is dependent on the poppler-qt4 library

=> Trash
   NewBreeze is now trash enabled. You can simple drag the files you want to trash into the trash icon of the side bar.
   Clicking the trash icon of the sidebar opens the trash gui, where you can see the files/folders you have trashed, sorted date wise.
