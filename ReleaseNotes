NewBreeze v2.1.0-preview
========================

This is a preview release of v2.1.0

=> NBApplicationsView( QAbstractItemView )
   NBApplicationsView is a categorized view displaying the installed GUI applications in your system. Editing these files is not yet possible.

=> NBCatalogView( QAbstractItemView )
   NBCatalogView is the NewBreeze equivalent of Windows 7's Libraries. It works as well in a similar fashion. You can add or remove folders
   from catalogs. There are four default catalogs, Documents, Music, Pictures and Videos. You can also add custom catalogs.

=> NBSidePanel contains links to these two new features. The first click on Application/Catalogs show the corresponding view and clicking again
   causes them to be hidden, showing the FolderView.

=> NBAppEngine and NBAppFile
   NBDesktopFile and NBConfigParser have become obsolete. In their place, I have introduced a new and improved NBAppFile and NBAppEngine.
   These are faster and more efficient than their counterparts and make full use of QMimeDatabase and QMimeType class of Qt5(backported to Qt4)

=> NBIconProvder now handles icons from /usr/share/pixmaps

=> NBSidePanel width is determined dynamically.

=> The OpenWith dialog box showing all the installed applications is now categorized, making it easy to search for an application.
   The categorization is based on the standard menu categories.

=> One can set the default program for a mimetype via the NBOpenWith Dialog. This process is freedesktop.org compliant.
   The external program "xdg-mime" is called with the relevant arguments, which then writes the changes to mimeapps.list
   While opening a program, the first listed program is the default program as per the freedesktop.org guidelines.
