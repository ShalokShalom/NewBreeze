NewBreeze v2.1.0-preview
========================

This is a preview release of v2.1.0

=> NBApplicationsView( QAbstractItemView )
   NBApplicationsView is a categorized view displaying the installed GUI applications in your system. Editing these files is not yet possible.

=> NBCatalogView( QAbstractItemView )
   NBCatalogView is the NewBreeze equivalent of Windows 7's Libraries. It works as well in a similar fashion. You can add or remove folders
   from catalogs. There are four default catalogs, Documents, Music, Pictures and Videos. The support for adding custom catalogs will be
   added in the beta release.

=> NBSidePanel contains links to these two new features. The first click on Application/Catalogs show the corresponding view and clicking again
   causes them to be hidden, showing the FolderView.

=> NBAppEngine and NBAppFile
   NBDesktopFile and NBConfigParser have become obsolete. In their place, I have introduced a new and improved NBAppFile and NBAppEngine.
   These are faster and more efficient than their counterparts and make full use of QMimeDatabase and QMimeType class of Qt5(backported to Qt4)

=> NBIconProvder now handles icons from /usr/share/pixmaps

=> NBSidePanel width is determined dynamically.
