NewBreeze v3.0.0
================

This is a completely native style GUI application. NewBreeze Native UI has been deprecated and removed. The main application itself is now natively styled. These are the
few changes in NewBreeze 3.

=> Qt5 Support
   - This release onwards Qt5 builds are supported. Use qmake-qt5 to build using Qt5.

=> User interface rebuilt, integrating code from NewBreeze and NewBreezeUI
   - File/Folder filtering

=> NBIconManager
    - NBIconManager now replaces old NBIconProvider
    - NBIconManager supports different icons for different sizes.
    - Very fast loading of icons

=> NBFileSystemWatcher
    - NBFileSystemWatcher was earlier rewritten with a cleaner code based on the inotify-example.c from http://www.lanedo.com/users/amorgado/fanotify/inotify-example.c
    - The above code was buggy and hence has been replaced with QFileSystemWatcher as the backend.

=> NBItemViewModel( QAbsractItemModel )
   - Formerly NBFileSystemModel, now it models Applications, Catalogs, and the FileSystem
   - Buffed up for better performance.
   - NBFileSystemModel provides upto 50% faster thumbnails for images.

=> NBIconView( QAbstractItemModel )
   - Per-folder views are now enabled. Each folder remembers its previous state ( size, grouping, list view, etc )
   - Fixed the small issue of mouse/cursor selection conflict.
   - Fixed the SegFault with cursor up and down movements.

=> UI
   - An elementary Accidental Delete Protection (ADP) has been added. However it is not mature enough for commercial use.

=> NBAddressBar redesigned
   - NBBreadCrumbsBar is now called NBCrumbsBar.
   - It redesigned to make sure long paths do not run out of the widget.
   - The full path can be displayed using FlowLayout at anytime.

=> NBSidePanel
   - A redesigned sidepanel with elegant menu listing the devices and bookmarks.
   - Devices show the space usage.

=> NBSideBar
   - A mac-like side panel
   - User can switch between classic and modern side panels

=> NBButton
   - NBButton has been rewritten to be a subclass of QPushButton, with better styling.
   - Issues with NBSegmentControl has caused me to go back to NBButtons, which "look" better.

=> NBPreviewInterface
   - NBPreviewInterface is deprecated and deleted.

=> NBPluginInterface
   - All plugins are updated to use the standard NBPluginInteface.
   - NBPluginInterface can be used easily to extend Preview support for NewBreeze.
   - Defaults Plugins will now be shipped with NewBreeze rather than as a separate repo.

=> NBArchive extended
   - NBArchive is now rebuilt using libarchive for archive processing
   - GZip, BZip2, and XZ files are processed independently
   - Archive creation now shows a pretty dialog with some options
   - Archive creation and extraction is done via QtConcurrent::run(...)
   - Archive previews are now available

=> SuperStart: A Super start to your day
   - All Drives are shown as you start NewBreeze
   - Find all the important files and folders as soon as you start NewBreeze
   - Press Ctrl+U to add file(s)/folder(s) to SuperStart
   - In SuperStart, press Delete to remove them.
   - A menu will be added later

=> NewBreeze Vault
   - This is work in progress. It will be completed by NB v3.0.0-rc1.
   - A single place to access all your encrypted files and folders
   - Use one key to lock/unlock the vault or add/remove files and folders from it.
   - Each added file or folder will be encrypted using a unique 1024 bit key.
