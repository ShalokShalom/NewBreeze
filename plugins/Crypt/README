NBCrypt Plugin
==============

A transparent files and folders encryption plugin for NewBreeze.

This plugin consists of two parts
  - NBEncFS
      This provides Qt interface for the commandline program encfs. Currently only mounting and unmounting is possible.
      Passowrd changing cannot be done.
      For more information on encfs visit their website: http://www.arg0.net/encfs

  - NBSalsa20
      This provides the Qt interface to Salsa20 Stream Cipher. Encryption, decryption and changing the password are possible.
      This is the implementation taken from https://github.com/everard/Salsa20, with some changes (removal of ucstk namespace, and reduction of indentation)
      Note: Large files take long time to encode/decode, and will be blocking, no async operation available as of now.
      For more information on Salsa visit Salsa20 website: https://cr.yp.to/salsa20.html

Note:
    1. To compile this plugin -std=c++11 enabled compiler is required. This implementation pf Salsa20 refuses to compile without -std=c++11 option.
    2. During file encryption/decryption, any existing file will be renamed to .orig without prompts.
